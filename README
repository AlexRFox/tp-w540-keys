To install:

make naga2014
sudo make install

Add disable_naga2014 and naga2014 to your startup processes for after
your X session starts.

Both disable_naga2014 and naga2014 will need to be rerun if the mouse
is removed and plugged back in.

If there aren't enough empty slots in your xmodmap configuration, this
will not map all function keys that naga2014 relies on, causing
naga2014 to crash for high valued keys. This can be fixed by manually
going through xmodmap and making sure F13-F24 all have keycodes.

This has not been thoroughly tested and might cause your computer to
crash or keyboard to lock up. Virtual terminals should still work even
if your keyboard is locked up in X, Ctr-Alt-F2 to get to one of them
and you should be able to fix your setup from there. You'll probably
just want to remove whatever auto-run thing is active and restart your
display manager.
